# A-Flappy-Night
My first frontend project: Flappy Bird at night! Flappy Bird couldn't fall asleep, so he went on a short flight while listening to some relaxing RnB music (I produced the music myself on FL Studio!) 

A custom Flappy Birdâ€“style game built with HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring:
- A city night background 
- Animated bird wings 
- Purple-tinted pipes for the night vibe 
- **Original background music produced by me on FL Studio ðŸŽ¶**
- Background music toggle button
- Smooth gameplay mechanics (gravity, jump physics, collision detection)
- Score tracking + Game Over screen



## How to Play
- Jump: You can press "Space", "Arrow Up", or "X" to make the bird jump.
- Avoid the pipes and try to get the highest score possible!
- Music can be toggled using the music button in the top right corner.



## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-night.git
   cd flappy-night
